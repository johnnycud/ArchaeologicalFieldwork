Developing an Android App for Hillfort Explorers
Firstly I used online sources for my App especially for splash screen, which worked fine, as did the base page for login and registering. 
But then the problems occured with the display of yhe login and register forms on the device, they were fine looking in Android studio but
would not display on device, I think there were issues with the API I was using.
I then try to incoporate the class labs system of building up a list for the hillforts, I encountered so many problems with this all 
features stopped working because of buib errors.
Apologies for its non functionality, in hindsight I should have followed labs from the begining and adjusted to my needs.
